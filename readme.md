# IT Service Desk
This is a cross platform, mobile app for the IT Service Desk, made in React Native. It supports checking print balence, filling out forms, contacting the service desk help line, and reading useful info.

## Building and Running
I used [Expo](https://expo.io) to make the React Native deveopment process a little easier. To build this application and test it out, download Node.js on your machine and then `npm install expo-cli --global`. Clone this repository, go to it, then do `expo run` to get everythign working in development mode. Although Expo will work on both MacOS and Windows, it is important to note that the iOS simulator will only run on Macs. However, Expo does provide an app for both iOS and Android that lets you run testing applications directly on your device, if you have one handy. I also found that because the WiFi can be a little strange on campus, it's best to use tunneling to connect to the Expo development server. 

## Things to do
Although I got everything to look good in development, there is still no formal built version of this app on either Android or iOS app stores. Future work could include compiling the app for both platforms, and then working with the school to post this officially. I also don't own an Android phone and had difficulties getting the simulator to work correctly, so an interested Android user could help me out and make sure everything works correctly. 

## Contributing code
Although everything is hosted in my personal GitHub, this is a project I did for the school, so if anyone wants to make any changes, feel free to submit a pull request, or just fork everything over into a new project. If you run into trouble with anything, have any questions, or need help with learning React Native, feel free to open an issue or get in touch; my email address should just be in my profile or my personal website.
